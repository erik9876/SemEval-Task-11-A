Definition: Expedition cruises are cruises with mostly smaller special ships, which enable travel routes off the beaten track. Expedition cruises have many other important characteristics that are not appreciated in this view. They are often seen as a hybrid between a cruise and a study trip, opening up regions that have not yet been explored by mass tourism.  Perhaps one or two people here will be interested, as it is not necessarily an everyday trip.  I look forward to your questions :)",0,0,1,0,0
